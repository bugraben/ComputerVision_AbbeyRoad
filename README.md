# ComputerVision_AbbeyRoad

<p>For this project, I was inspired by the theory of large numbers. I tried to get a clear picture of the iconic Abbey Road from its video recordings during rush hour. I used OpenCV and Numpy. I got the results that I wanted. In conclusion, I could get clearer images by increasing the sample count. However, as a side effect, some of the textures lost their sharpness. </p>
