# ComputerVision_AbbeyRoad

For this projet I inspired by the theory of large numbers. I tried to get a clear picture of a street from its video recordings at rush hour. I used OpenCV and Numpy. Due to limitations of the Numpy library, I couldn't get the results I wanted. However, I have got results gives hope.
