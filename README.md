# ComputerVision_AbbeyRoad

For this projet i inspired by the theory of large numbers. I tried to get a clear picture of a street from its video recordings at rush hour. I used OpenCV and Numpy. Due to limitations of the Numpy library, i couldn't get the results i wanted. However, i have got results gives hope.
